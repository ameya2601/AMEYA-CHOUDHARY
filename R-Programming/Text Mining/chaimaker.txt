     I purchased this kettle with a lot of hopes and really wanted it to work, but there are too many issues - at least with the piece that I got - leading me to give this two stars, and request a return.First of all, the kettle has got 4 heating modes from low to high. The first thing I noticed when starting this kettle was that  whenever I select one of the lower modes, the lights in my entire home start fluctuating. Not just when it starts heating, but continuously. Strangely, this does not seem to happen, or happens very little with the highest heating mode. But the lower I go the more the lights start to flicker. The flickering is a bit difficult to capture on camera but immediately noticeable in real life. I have tried to upload a video here that shows the flickering even though it’s hard to capture on camSecondly, the kettle has a really bad smell, like that of burning plastic, specially when you use it for a while. I wouldn't consume anything from a kettle that smells like that.Next, if you are looking for a pure steel/glass kettle and avoid plastics/silicone, this is not the one. The container is made of glass, but the heating element is made of steel. And they are using what looks like a grey/blue silicone seal to interface the glass and the steel parts. This happens at the base of the kettle where the water is hottest. So your hot water/milk is exposed to the silicone seal as well as whatever sealant they have used there. That is also probably what causes the smell. Also, the lid has a rubber seal.The product is made in China, and from my experience above, does not seem to be following strong quality controls.The controls on the top seem to be capacitive so they would only work with your fingers (like a touch screen).The device although does not look cheap from anywhere, also does not inspire confidence on its reliability and ruggedness. It doesn't seem like it is the sort of device that would last long. And in my case of course it seems faulty from day 1.Some pros of the device that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1:The water boils real fastSupports boiling milkLarge enough for everyday useThe device looks good - does not look cheap, and the glass  does not seem like it would break very easily (though it will definitely break if you don't take care)There is variable heating and a keep warm function that keeps water/milk warm after the heating is doneOverall this seems like a device that promises a lot but fails to deliver. I really wanted to like this device but electrical as well as health hazards (from the smell) make it a strict no. Maybe Borosil would do better in the next iteration of their product, but from my perspective I cannot recommend anyone to buy this kettle.

    The concept of the product is amazing and it just looks absolutely beautiful!! However, it is not for making the \"kadak masala chai\" that the Indian palate demands, perhaps excellent for the user in love with its weaker cousin - the \"chai tea\" so popular in coffee shops around the world.The milk-tea setting imitates the boiling-simmer-boiling action used by most people to make tea however it somehow does not produce the same result as the stove top version.Another major drawback is that the minimum level of milk+water required to run the machine is 400ml so it's not suitable for a single user.Was very excited to receive the stunning product but had to return it with a heavy heart just because the tea prepared by it was not what I like to drink.

    Well personally bi love the product but it has few draw back, such as the minimum quantity is too much it almost for 6 cups of tea, it should have been lesser for smaller families. Secondly I would like to add the guide book should have been better as having better instructions of how to make a perfect cup. Thing really get heated once tea is made the rubber insulation on top should have been better adjusted as we need to adjust it for every use.

    Thinking it’s a good brand bought it, noticed the milk was getting burnt at the bottom, within a month a crack developed in the glass then the unit stopped functioning.Spoke to customer care - after long wait the engineer came and said looks like Base connector is faulty and replaced it, for the jar he said I will ha e to pay for it even though it was damaged due to faulty heating coil. After two days of repair the water kept boiling, never went into warm mode, milk was boiled and it overflowed.Called up customer care again - waiting for executive it’s been a week n still waiting.Dear if you buying this product- please dnt - it’s useless, it looks good but performance is pathetic. What is the point of buying a milk boiler when after use, you spend 10 minutes cleaning the vessel. What is the use within one month the machine is faulty.There have been many bad reviews of this machine. So before buying it please beware.

    I bought this item to take to USA even though I was advised against it. I bought a UMI Step Up transformer in USA to step up the voltage from 110v to 220v to power this tea maker.This was the best decision ever as I am a tea lover and tea is really hard to find in cafes/restaurants in US. This saves me a lot of time in morning I can put in milk and tea in and start the chai maker and not worry about monitoring it. When I am back from my shower its all ready and I can take it with me to work.Cons:- I would really appreciate if Borosil makes international version of this so that more people can buy it to take it to US.- There are some design flaws with this hai maker though: one is that when you pick up the kettle there is a lot of moisture developed on the cover and it all falls down the plastic handle.- Its a little hard to clean the kettle as the boiled milk forms a coating on the bottom of it that is heard to clean. I am not sure how this can be tackled in the next iteration of this product though.- When I turn back on the chai maker there is no option to use the Keep Warm option.

The first thing I noticed when starting this kettle was that  whenever I select one of the lower modes, the lights in my entire home start fluctuating. Not just when it starts heating, but continuously. Strangely, this does not seem to happen, or happens very little with the highest heating mode. But the lower I go the more the lights start to flicker. The flickering is a bit difficult to capture on camera but immediately noticeable in real life. I have tried to upload a video here that shows the flickering even though it’s hard to capture on camSecondly, the kettle has a really bad smell, like that of burning plastic, specially when you use it for a while. I wouldn't consume anything from a kettle that smells like that.Next, if you are looking for a pure steel/glass kettle and avoid plastics/silicone, this is not the one. The container is made of glass, but the heating element is made of steel. And they are using what looks like a grey/blue silicone seal to interface the glass and the steel parts. This happens at the base of the kettle where the water is hottest. So your hot water/milk is exposed to the silicone seal as well as whatever sealant they have used there. That is also probably what causes the smell. Also, the lid has a rubber seal.The product is made in China, and from my experience above, does not seem to be following strong quality controls.The controls on the top seem to be capacitive so they would only work with your fingers (like a touch screen).The device although does not look cheap from anywhere, also does not inspire confidence on its reliability and ruggedness. It doesn't seem like it is the sort of device that would last long. And in my case of course it seems faulty from day 1.Some pros of the device that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1:The water boils real fastSupports boiling milkLarge enough for everyday useThe device looks good - does not look cheap, and the glass  does not seem like it would break very easily (though it will definitely break if you don't take care)There is variable heating and a keep warm function that keeps water/milk warm after the heating is doneOverall this seems like a device that promises a lot but fails to deliver. I really wanted to like this device but electrical as well as health hazards (from the smell) make it a strict no. Maybe Borosil would do better in the next iteration of their product, but from my perspective I cannot recommend anyone to buy this kettle.

    The concept of the product is amazing and it just looks absolutely beautiful!! However, it is not for making the \"kadak masala chai\" that the Indian palate demands, perhaps excellent for the user in love with its weaker cousin - the \"chai tea\" so popular in coffee shops around the world.The milk-tea setting imitates the boiling-simmer-boiling action used by most people to make tea however it somehow does not produce the same result as the stove top version.Another major drawback is that the minimum level of milk+water required to run the machine is 400ml so it's not suitable for a single user.Was very excited to receive the stunning product but had to return it with a heavy heart just because the tea prepared by it was not what I like to drink.

    Well personally bi love the product but it has few draw back, such as the minimum quantity is too much it almost for 6 cups of tea, it should have been lesser for smaller families. Secondly I would like to add the guide book should have been better as having better instructions of how to make a perfect cup. Thing really get heated once tea is made the rubber insulation on top should have been better adjusted as we need to adjust it for every use.

    Thinking it’s a good brand bought it, noticed the milk was getting burnt at the bottom, within a month a crack developed in the glass then the unit stopped functioning.Spoke to customer care - after long wait the engineer came and said looks like Base connector is faulty and replaced it, for the jar he said I will ha e to pay for it even though it was damaged due to faulty heating coil. After two days of repair the water kept boiling, never went into warm mode, milk was boiled and it overflowed.Called up customer care again - waiting for executive it’s been a week n still waiting.Dear if you buying this product- please dnt - it’s useless, it looks good but performance is pathetic. What is the point of buying a milk boiler when after use, you spend 10 minutes cleaning the vessel. What is the use within one month the machine is faulty.There have been many bad reviews of this machine. So before buying it please beware.

    I bought this item to take to USA even though I was advised against it. I bought a UMI Step Up transformer in USA to step up the voltage from 110v to 220v to power this tea maker.This was the best decision ever as I am a tea lover and tea is really hard to find in cafes/restaurants in US. This saves me a lot of time in morning I can put in milk and tea in and start the chai maker and not worry about monitoring it. When I am back from my shower its all ready and I can take it with me to work.Cons:- I would really appreciate if Borosil makes international version of this so that more people can buy it to take it to US.- There are some design flaws with this hai maker though: one is that when you pick up the kettle there is a lot of moisture developed on the cover and it all falls down the plastic handle.- Its a little hard to clean the kettle as the boiled milk forms a coating on the bottom of it that is heard to clean. I am not sure how this can be tackled in the next iteration of this product though.- When I turn back on the chai maker there is no option to use the Keep Warm option.

The first thing I noticed when starting this kettle was that  whenever I select one of the lower modes, the lights in my entire home start fluctuating. Not just when it starts heating, but continuously. Strangely, this does not seem to happen, or happens very little with the highest heating mode. But the lower I go the more the lights start to flicker. The flickering is a bit difficult to capture on camera but immediately noticeable in real life. I have tried to upload a video here that shows the flickering even though it’s hard to capture on camSecondly, the kettle has a really bad smell, like that of burning plastic, specially when you use it for a while. I wouldn't consume anything from a kettle that smells like that.Next, if you are looking for a pure steel/glass kettle and avoid plastics/silicone, this is not the one. The container is made of glass, but the heating element is made of steel. And they are using what looks like a grey/blue silicone seal to interface the glass and the steel parts. This happens at the base of the kettle where the water is hottest. So your hot water/milk is exposed to the silicone seal as well as whatever sealant they have used there. That is also probably what causes the smell. Also, the lid has a rubber seal.The product is made in China, and from my experience above, does not seem to be following strong quality controls.The controls on the top seem to be capacitive so they would only work with your fingers (like a touch screen).The device although does not look cheap from anywhere, also does not inspire confidence on its reliability and ruggedness. It doesn't seem like it is the sort of device that would last long. And in my case of course it seems faulty from day 1.Some pros of the device that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1:The water boils real fastSupports boiling milkLarge enough for everyday useThe device looks good - does not look cheap, and the glass  does not seem like it would break very easily (though it will definitely break if you don't take care)There is variable heating and a keep warm function that keeps water/milk warm after the heating is doneOverall this seems like a device that promises a lot but fails to deliver. I really wanted to like this device but electrical as well as health hazards (from the smell) make it a strict no. Maybe Borosil would do better in the next iteration of their product, but from my perspective I cannot recommend anyone to buy this kettle.

    The concept of the product is amazing and it just looks absolutely beautiful!! However, it is not for making the \"kadak masala chai\" that the Indian palate demands, perhaps excellent for the user in love with its weaker cousin - the \"chai tea\" so popular in coffee shops around the world.The milk-tea setting imitates the boiling-simmer-boiling action used by most people to make tea however it somehow does not produce the same result as the stove top version.Another major drawback is that the minimum level of milk+water required to run the machine is 400ml so it's not suitable for a single user.Was very excited to receive the stunning product but had to return it with a heavy heart just because the tea prepared by it was not what I like to drink.

    Well personally bi love the product but it has few draw back, such as the minimum quantity is too much it almost for 6 cups of tea, it should have been lesser for smaller families. Secondly I would like to add the guide book should have been better as having better instructions of how to make a perfect cup. Thing really get heated once tea is made the rubber insulation on top should have been better adjusted as we need to adjust it for every use.

    Thinking it’s a good brand bought it, noticed the milk was getting burnt at the bottom, within a month a crack developed in the glass then the unit stopped functioning.Spoke to customer care - after long wait the engineer came and said looks like Base connector is faulty and replaced it, for the jar he said I will ha e to pay for it even though it was damaged due to faulty heating coil. After two days of repair the water kept boiling, never went into warm mode, milk was boiled and it overflowed.Called up customer care again - waiting for executive it’s been a week n still waiting.Dear if you buying this product- please dnt - it’s useless, it looks good but performance is pathetic. What is the point of buying a milk boiler when after use, you spend 10 minutes cleaning the vessel. What is the use within one month the machine is faulty.There have been many bad reviews of this machine. So before buying it please beware.

    I bought this item to take to USA even though I was advised against it. I bought a UMI Step Up transformer in USA to step up the voltage from 110v to 220v to power this tea maker.This was the best decision ever as I am a tea lover and tea is really hard to find in cafes/restaurants in US. This saves me a lot of time in morning I can put in milk and tea in and start the chai maker and not worry about monitoring it. When I am back from my shower its all ready and I can take it with me to work.Cons:- I would really appreciate if Borosil makes international version of this so that more people can buy it to take it to US.- There are some design flaws with this hai maker though: one is that when you pick up the kettle there is a lot of moisture developed on the cover and it all falls down the plastic handle.- Its a little hard to clean the kettle as the boiled milk forms a coating on the bottom of it that is heard to clean. I am not sure how this can be tackled in the next iteration of this product though.- When I turn back on the chai maker there is no option to use the Keep Warm option.

The first thing I noticed when starting this kettle was that  whenever I select one of the lower modes, the lights in my entire home start fluctuating. Not just when it starts heating, but continuously. Strangely, this does not seem to happen, or happens very little with the highest heating mode. But the lower I go the more the lights start to flicker. The flickering is a bit difficult to capture on camera but immediately noticeable in real life. I have tried to upload a video here that shows the flickering even though it’s hard to capture on camSecondly, the kettle has a really bad smell, like that of burning plastic, specially when you use it for a while. I wouldn't consume anything from a kettle that smells like that.Next, if you are looking for a pure steel/glass kettle and avoid plastics/silicone, this is not the one. The container is made of glass, but the heating element is made of steel. And they are using what looks like a grey/blue silicone seal to interface the glass and the steel parts. This happens at the base of the kettle where the water is hottest. So your hot water/milk is exposed to the silicone seal as well as whatever sealant they have used there. That is also probably what causes the smell. Also, the lid has a rubber seal.The product is made in China, and from my experience above, does not seem to be following strong quality controls.The controls on the top seem to be capacitive so they would only work with your fingers (like a touch screen).The device although does not look cheap from anywhere, also does not inspire confidence on its reliability and ruggedness. It doesn't seem like it is the sort of device that would last long. And in my case of course it seems faulty from day 1.Some pros of the device that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1:The water boils real fastSupports boiling milkLarge enough for everyday useThe device looks good - does not look cheap, and the glass  does not seem like it would break very easily (though it will definitely break if you don't take care)There is variable heating and a keep warm function that keeps water/milk warm after the heating is doneOverall this seems like a device that promises a lot but fails to deliver. I really wanted to like this device but electrical as well as health hazards (from the smell) make it a strict no. Maybe Borosil would do better in the next iteration of their product, but from my perspective I cannot recommend anyone to buy this kettle.

    The concept of the product is amazing and it just looks absolutely beautiful!! However, it is not for making the \"kadak masala chai\" that the Indian palate demands, perhaps excellent for the user in love with its weaker cousin - the \"chai tea\" so popular in coffee shops around the world.The milk-tea setting imitates the boiling-simmer-boiling action used by most people to make tea however it somehow does not produce the same result as the stove top version.Another major drawback is that the minimum level of milk+water required to run the machine is 400ml so it's not suitable for a single user.Was very excited to receive the stunning product but had to return it with a heavy heart just because the tea prepared by it was not what I like to drink.

    Well personally bi love the product but it has few draw back, such as the minimum quantity is too much it almost for 6 cups of tea, it should have been lesser for smaller families. Secondly I would like to add the guide book should have been better as having better instructions of how to make a perfect cup. Thing really get heated once tea is made the rubber insulation on top should have been better adjusted as we need to adjust it for every use.

    Thinking it’s a good brand bought it, noticed the milk was getting burnt at the bottom, within a month a crack developed in the glass then the unit stopped functioning.Spoke to customer care - after long wait the engineer came and said looks like Base connector is faulty and replaced it, for the jar he said I will ha e to pay for it even though it was damaged due to faulty heating coil. After two days of repair the water kept boiling, never went into warm mode, milk was boiled and it overflowed.Called up customer care again - waiting for executive it’s been a week n still waiting.Dear if you buying this product- please dnt - it’s useless, it looks good but performance is pathetic. What is the point of buying a milk boiler when after use, you spend 10 minutes cleaning the vessel. What is the use within one month the machine is faulty.There have been many bad reviews of this machine. So before buying it please beware.

    I bought this item to take to USA even though I was advised against it. I bought a UMI Step Up transformer in USA to step up the voltage from 110v to 220v to power this tea maker.This was the best decision ever as I am a tea lover and tea is really hard to find in cafes/restaurants in US. This saves me a lot of time in morning I can put in milk and tea in and start the chai maker and not worry about monitoring it. When I am back from my shower its all ready and I can take it with me to work.Cons:- I would really appreciate if Borosil makes international version of this so that more people can buy it to take it to US.- There are some design flaws with this hai maker though: one is that when you pick up the kettle there is a lot of moisture developed on the cover and it all falls down the plastic handle.- Its a little hard to clean the kettle as the boiled milk forms a coating on the bottom of it that is heard to clean. I am not sure how this can be tackled in the next iteration of this product though.- When I turn back on the chai maker there is no option to use the Keep Warm option.

    The product still needs further innovatoon since programming functions are insufficient enough to understand as water not reaching to boiling point.Operator menu not/functional errors are not briefed properly.The product nor at par to cater to early morning fast necessity and requirement for chai or milk or hot water preparation.
