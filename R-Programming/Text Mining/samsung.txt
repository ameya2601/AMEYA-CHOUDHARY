    The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

    Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.

    S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.

    Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default \"vibrant\" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.

    S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.

    Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default \"vibrant\" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.

    The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

    Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.

For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.

    The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

    Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.

    Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.

    S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.

    Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default \"vibrant\" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.

    S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.

    Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default \"vibrant\" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.
